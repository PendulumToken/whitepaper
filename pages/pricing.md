# Smart Pricing

## Finding the right price

* Determining the market price for your time is a challenging task. You can ask your peers, perform online searches to see how you measure up, or simply base it on your current salary. But what you don't know are the prices that people similar to you are actually getting booked, and how often they get booked. You also cannot tell how much interest you are generating or if the attention buyers are willing to pay the prices you are asking. This is where the smart pricing comes in, by keeping your prices competitve as demand for you (and people similar to you) changes.

* The goal of smart pricing is to increase the chance of you getting booked, while respecting the amount of time you are willing to sell.

* Smart pricing utilizes machine learning to develop continuously evolving predictive pricing models taking into account several factors including:
    - Work history
    - Skills and endorsements
    - Interests
    - Education
    - Reputation
    - Trust
    - Booking history
    - Market popularity
    - Seasonality
    
* By taking advantage of these predictive pricing models and real-time market analysis, your prices can be automatically adjusted to match market demands.
    
## Personalization and controls

* Pricing our time is personal. Although smart pricing allows you to automatically set your price to match market demands, everyone is unique and personalization is important.

* The <strong>minimum price</strong> you set is the lowest your price will go when demand for your time is low. This means your price may drop to attract more booking, but never below the threshold you set.

* The <strong>maximum price</strong> you set is the highest price your listing can be booked for, even on high demands, in order to keep your price affordable. This setting is optional but highly encouraged.

* The price range lever helps you determine how likely a block of time will get booked given a particular price at the current market conditions. This allows you to see the effects of different price points.

* Smart pricing is enabled by default, but can be disabled if you wish to use flat pricing.

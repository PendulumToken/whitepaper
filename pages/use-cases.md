# Use Cases

The Pendulum protocol has a variety of use cases for dapp developers who can benefit from dynamic pricing for buying and selling time.

## Attention Markets

Attention markets allow advertisers, publishers, and users to interchange in a token driven advertising and media model. Instead of giving up their attention for free to centralized aggregators like Facebook and Google, users can monetize their own attention and time directly to advertisers, and publishers and compensated for quality content.

## Sales and Business Development

Capturing the attention of high value customers is crucial but also challenging since these key people are also the most pressed for time. The best way to generate sales and business development leads is to couple a trusted referral with an incentive, and this can be approached with the Pendulum protocol.

## Consultants, Advisory, and Influencers

Professional advisors and consultants can safely monetize their expertise in a global knowledge network without giving up high fees to a centralized intermediary. Influencers and celebrities can connect to their ardent fans and others who would pay to have access to them via a call or group chat.

## Microtasks - Mechanical Turk

Currently dominated by Amazon Mechanical Turk and Crowdflower, microtasks are small, simple tasks that require human judgment and can be completed independently over the internet. A decentralized protocol shrinks the fees that plague this space, while international workers who are unbanked and without identity can earn a fair wage for completing small tasks.

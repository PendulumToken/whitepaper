# Pendulum Protocol Overview

The Pendulum Protocol connects attention buyers and sellers, and negotiates exchanges between them. The value of attention for an individual or group can be fairly priced in real-time, driven by market demands and supply functions. Blocks of time can be broken down into ever smaller increments or reaggregated into larger blocks. Buyers and sellers can be effectively matched based on their needs, skills, and interests. And trust between buyers and sellers can be mitigated through skin-in-the-game staking and reputation mechanisms.

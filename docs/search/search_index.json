You can ask your peers, perform online searches to see how you measure up, or simply base it on your current salary. But what you don't know are the prices that people similar to you are actually getting booked, and how often they get booked. You also cannot tell how much interest you are generating or if the attention buyers are willing to pay the prices you are asking. This is where the smart pricing comes in, by keeping your prices competitve as demand for you (and people similar to you) changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of smart pricing is to increase the chance of you getting booked, while respecting the amount of time you are willing to sell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart pricing utilizes machine learning to develop continuously evolving predictive pricing models taking into account several factors including:\n\n\n\n\nWork history\n\n\nSkills and endorsements\n\n\nInterests\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nReputation\n\n\nTrust\n\n\nBooking history\n\n\nMarket popularity\n\n\nSeasonality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy taking advantage of these predictive pricing models and real-time market analysis, your prices can be automatically adjusted to match market demands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonalization and controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing our time is personal.
